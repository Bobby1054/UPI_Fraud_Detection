# UPI_Fraud_Detection

## Description

The **UPI Fraud Detection** project aims to identify fraudulent transactions in a UPI (Unified Payments Interface) transaction dataset. By using machine learning models such as Random Forest, this project classifies transactions as either legitimate or fraudulent based on various features of the transaction data.

The dataset contains transaction logs, and the goal is to predict whether a transaction is fraudulent or not. The solution uses a classification algorithm to train the model and make predictions on new transaction data.
